# MikuMikuMobile

This repository contains an experimental design for a smartphone application that allows users to create dance videos using MMD-compatible 3D models. Pose estimation runs locally on the device and the phone's motion acts as a virtual camera.

The full development document is available in [docs/development.md](docs/development.md). A shorter architecture summary can be found in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
