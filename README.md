# MikuMikuMobile

This repository contains an experimental design for a smartphone application that allows users to create dance videos with MMD-compatible 3D characters. Models are imported at runtime, pose is estimated from reference videos, and users can record the result while moving their phone as a virtual camera.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for an overview of the planned architecture.
